# History of Serverbot

## `bot` (February 2016 - July 2018)
This project started in early 2016 as a personal tool for quickly gathering metrics from servers running GNU/Linux operating systems and sending alerts to Telegram when thresholds had been met. It was simply called `bot` and didn't have many features.

## `TelegramBots` (July 2018 - January 2019)
`bot` was put on GitHub with the more descriptive name [TelegramBots](https://github.com/sveeke/TelegramBots). Its features and support for different GNU/Linux systems were improved a bit. Because of the transfer to Nozel, this repository was archived in January 2019.

## `Serverbot` / `linux-serverbot` (December 2018 - December 2023)
When the Nozel organization was formed in 2018, the project was renamed to [Serverbot](https://github.com/nozel-org/linux-serverbot) and moved to its new home. Some new features and better support were added. Then in December 2023 it was archived because support for GNU/Linux based operating systems was dropped.

## `freebsd-serverbot` / `Serverbot` (June 2020 - ongoing)
As FreeBSD was used frequently for Nozel's production systems, the need for a FreeBSD version of Serverbot grew. In June 2020 `freebsd-serverbot` was created and over the coarse of time more features were added. In December 2023 GNU/Linux support was dropped completely because we didn't have any GNU/Linux systems left. `freebsd-serverbot` became [Serverbot](https://codeberg.org/nozel/serverbot).
